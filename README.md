### Bagels

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret four-digit number based on clues.

The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess:
- “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place 
- “Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place and
- “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits. 

For example, if the secret number was 2148 and your guess was 8439, the clues would be Fermi Pico.

You have 4 tries to guess the secret number.

Number of tries and secret number's length can be configured in game.

A version of this game is featured in the book "The Big Book of Small Python Projects" by Al Sweigart.
